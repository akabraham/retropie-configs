*** EMULATOR INFORMATION ***

To play this game, you'll need a SNES emulator of your choosing. If you're playing on PC, I recommend SNES9x (latest version: 1.54.1) as it works flawlessly and is compatible with the included savestate (more on that below). Head over to www.snes9x.com and get that set up first. You can also find other emulators for other devices i.e. iOS, Android, Modded Wii, etc. A quick google search of "Best SNES emulator for (platform)" should get you going in the right direction.

The included savestate file "NBA Jam 2k17.000" goes in the SNES9x savestate folder (Typically snes9x > Saves). Load it to access the options menu. Unfortunately the screen is broken on it's own, so you won't be able to change the game clock speed / AI difficulty / etc. without this. It's a bit of an annoying bug, but not game breaking, and this is the best work around I could find.

*** PERSONAL ***

I am a proud testicular cancer survivor and will be running the 2017 Boston Marathon in honor of my late step mom on April 18th, 2017. I am not looking to profit from this project, but if you would like to make a donation, please consider donating to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. My goal is to raise $10,000 by the start of the marathon. You can find my marathon challenge donation page here: www.rundfmc.org/2017/ethanmiller. All money raised goes directly to help fund cancer research.

Thank you very much for your consideration.



*** SPECIAL THANKS ***

Thanks so much to everyone at NLSC (nba-live.com) and the NBA2K subreddit (reddit.com/r/nba2k) for keeping me interested in this project and helping me see this thing through to the end. Big thanks to Mattrizzle from smwcentral.net - without him sharing everything he knows about NBA Jam on the net, none of this would have been possible. 
I really hope you guys enjoy this project, it truly was a labor of love. LONG LIVE NBA JAM!
