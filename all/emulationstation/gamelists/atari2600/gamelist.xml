		<desc>A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<name>Adventures of TRON</name>
		<desc>Adventures of TRON is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.</desc>

		<name>Air Raid</name>
		<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

		<desc>There are six basic types of game available in Air-Sea Battle, and for each type, there are one or two groups of three games, for a total of twenty-seven game variants. Within each group, variant one is the standard game, variant two features guided missiles which can be directed left or right after being fired, and variant three pits a single player (using the right gun) against a computer opponent, which simply fires continuously at the default angle or speed. In every game, players shoot targets (enemy planes or ships, shooting gallery targets, or each other, depending on the game chosen) competing to get a higher score. Each round lasts two minutes and sixteen seconds; the player with the higher score after time expires is the winner, unless one player wins (and ends the game) by reaching 99 points before the time is up.</desc>

Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>

		<desc>In this game based, loosely, on the movie of the same name, you have to move through a maze (the halls of your ship in the manual), ala Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs).

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</desc>

You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower.

		<desc>Rescue a damsel in distress from being burned alive by moving around in your helicopter and putting out the flame with your fire hose. Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your "joystick" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her. If you save her, you will be rewarded with a dirty little animation. The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.

Bachelorette Party is an "x-rated" version of Breakout. Move the Spanish fly so that the woman comes in contact with it. She will then ricochet toward the men and "score" with each one she touches. She will then bounce back toward the fly. If you miss her, you lose a turn. The fun part is watching the men's willies go up and down as she flies toward them. The roles of the men and women are switched in Bachelor Party.</desc>

		<desc>Basic Math is a math game for children.

Each game gives the player a set of ten basic math problems (i.e. simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to solve. The player is presented with two numbers and a function, then inputs the answer by cycling through numbers with the joystick. A timer option is available to ramp up the difficulty. The game has eight primary game settings - basically two settings for each mathematical function. Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions.</desc>

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.

To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</desc>

that has been passed down from generation-to-generation as part of the culture's oral
tradition.

The object of the game is to eat 'em every time he beats 'em. You score one point for
each and every drop you swallow without a miss. But should you miss, shame on you. You lose one turn. After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.

You have four turns at the outset of the game. Small squares in the lower left-hand
corner of the screen indicate the remaining number of turns at any point in the game.

You can earn "bonus turns" for every "69" points you score; however, you may
accumulate no more than 6 turns plus the one in play at any given time.</desc>

The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player starts the game with 200 chips and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same switch. He will then start with 200 chips.</desc>

		<name>Blueprint</name>
		<desc>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of "Fast run time" (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</desc>

		<name>Bowling</name>
		<desc>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).

If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.

If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.

An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.

The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</desc>

		<name>Boxing</name>
		<desc>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.
While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</desc>

		<desc>In Brain Games one or two players attempt to earn as many points as possible by solving various puzzles presented by the computer. There are six different puzzles included, which are:
•Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.
•Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.
•Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.
•Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.
•Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.
•Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</desc>

There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat.  Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS.  This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance.  Your time consumption is crucial to your survival.  

If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships.  The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it.  You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP.  

Be aggressive but don't be reckless.  This is do or die cosmic combat and it's the MOTHER SHIP or YOU!</desc>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

		<desc>CANYON BOMBER GAMES

GAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.

Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.

Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.

GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. 

Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your own.  Bombs away!

GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay "suspended" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.

GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.

GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.

No "miss indicator" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.

GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.

GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)

Inspired by this, Chase the Chuckwagon was produced by Spectravision and released as a promotional item from the Ralston Purina Company. Buy lots of dog food and you could own this. The simple rarity of this game combined with its historical coolness makes it one of the "holy grail" games. The object is to navigate the dog through a maze in an effort to reach the chuckwagon, while avoiding the dog catcher and other obstacles. If he makes it, an animation shows the dog chasing after the chuckwagon and stopping to eat the dog food that falls out of it.</desc>

You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</desc>

They must be destroyed! Each paratrooper allowed to land on a building destroys a portion of that building. If three paratroopers land on a building. It will be totally destroyed and must be considered under commando control.

Worse still, the androids can now tunnel towards your gun emplacement. Each paratrooper who lands on that building expands the tunnel. If they are not stopped, they will plant an explosive charge under the gun.

In the midst of the battle, an aircraft may appear. It will drop a devastating bomb which can destroy all buildings and the gun emplacement. You must shoot it down or at least shoot the bomb it drops. If you miss, its back to basic training!</desc>

You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</desc>

		<desc>Defender is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling shooting game set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.</desc>

		<desc>This sequel adds new enemy ships to the alien fleet such as firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies (note that Yllabian is based on "Yllab", the word "Bally" spelled backwards, a friendly poke at Williams' then-competitor, Bally Midway), Dynamos and Space Hums. The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave. As in the first game, if all the humans are captured the planet explodes and turns all the landers into mutants.</desc>

Fill in all of the boxes before you run out of gas or crash into another car. The other cars can also erase the work you've done. If you're in a tight spot, hit the button to shift into gas-guzzlin' overdrive. As the game progresses, the speed and intelligence of the other drivers increase.</desc>

		<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

		<name>Dolphin</name>
		<desc>Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...

You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:

THE SEAGULL:  
Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.

THE SLIP:  
Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him "the slip".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.

SCORING:  
Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.

Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</desc>

Game 1: Straight-ahead Dragster, one or two players.
Game 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.

Your Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal. Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.

To shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.

Your car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.

When the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.

The object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.</desc>

The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving.

Evil scientists and agents wander around the area, trying to capture E.T. and steal the parts he's carrying.</desc>

After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  

To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</desc>

		<name>Fishing Derby</name>
		<desc>This is one of the Activision video games that is fun to play even if you don't know the rules.  So go ahead!  Use your Joystick Controllers.  And when you're ready to find out why some fish bite and some don't, how to tell the whoppers from the lunkers and--especially--how to keep the shark from eating your catch, read these simple instructions.  Good Luck!

Game 1:  You against the Activision computer fisherman.
Game 2:  You against another player.

Use left Joystick Controller for fisherman on the left pier and to play against the computer (Game 1).

Use right Joystick Controller for fisherman on the right pier (Game 2). 

Move your Joystick from left to right to move your pole out and back.  To lower and raise your line, move the Joystick up and down. 

Choose your difficulty or handicap for each player (or the computer):
* A (up) - Fish won't bite unless you get the end of your line right under his nose.
* B (down) - Fish will bite if you get the end of the line near his mouth.

(Hint: When learning FISHING DERBY, handicap the computer at A, and put  your switch at B.)

SCORING:
There are six rows of fish.  From the top  down, they count as follows:              
* First two rows:  2 pounds each
* Second two rows: 4 pounds each
* Bottom two rows: 6 pounds each

The big ones are down deep.  Go for 'em!

First player to land 99 lbs. of those beautiful fish wins.</desc>

After programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players.  The offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or punt.  The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red controller button down, the defensive
back.

The players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by your Joystick.

GAME 2: 
In this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will follow the play exactly as programmed.  Use more strategy and try to outguess your opponent's plays.

GAME 3: 
Program in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them out.  Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.</desc>

		<desc>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points</desc>

One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "get to the other side." Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.</desc>

		<path>./Frogs and Flies.bin</path>
		<name>Frogs and Flies</name>
		<desc>Frogs and Flies is a 1982 video game by Mattel for the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 platforms. In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.
Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a "The End" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.
There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.
A version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.</desc>

		<desc>Front Line (フロントライン Furonto Rain?) is a military-themed run &amp; gun shooter game released by Taito for arcades in 1982. It was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades.[citation needed] Military-oriented video games of the early 1980s usually involved vehicular combat, such as tanks, but did not include infantry. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button, which fires the weapon. The single button is used to throw grenades, and to enter and exit the tank.

1985's Ikari Warriors follows the conventions established by Front Line, including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>In the single-player mode, the player controls a G.I. Joe training camp on the bottom of the screen protected by a barrier and armed with two laser cannons. In this mode the goal is to keep the giant Cobra-operated robot snake from destroying the shield and thus the training camp by hitting it eight times. The Cobra robot shoots venom and laser beams.
In two-player cooperative mode control of the G.I. Joe training game is split between two players as they work to destroy the Cobra robot. In the two-player competition mode one player controls the Cobra robot and another player controls the training camp.
Cobra Strike was the first video game to use the G.I. Joe license. The U.K. version of the game was renamed Action Man: Action Force.

Synopsis:
"The Action Force training camp is under siege from a giant Cobra Combat Machine built by the evil Baron Ironblood. As the Cobra looms over the camp the Action Force recruits run to shelter from its vaporizing venom and piercing laser beams. Man your positions! Defend the camp! Use missile attack cannons and atomic-powered energy shields to fight the deadly Cobra."</desc>

		<desc>Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of "mood slime." Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's "courage" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up "elixir" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of "mood slime" to keep the statue moving.</desc>

The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</desc>

Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</desc>

With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

		<name>Hangman</name>
		<desc>Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 are one-player games. You compete against the computer. You score one point for every Hangman Word you complete; the computer scores one point for each Hangman Word you can't complete.

GAME 1:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 2:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 3:
Playing with words from a first through ninth grade level, one player competes against the computer.

GAME 4:
Words from a first through high school vocabulary are used for competition between one player and the computer.


Games 5, 6, 7 and 8 are two-player games against the computer. After you select the game vocabulary you want to use, you and your opponent take turns selecting alphabet letters to find the word generated by the computer. Both players together are allowed 11 incorrect selections. When you make a correct letter guess, you receive a consecutive turn. The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.

GAME 5:
Two players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 6:
Two players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 7:
Words from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.

GAME 8:
Two players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.


GAME 9:
Now it's your turn to choose the Hangman Word. Instead of playing with a computer word, one player composes the Hangman Word with the Joystick Controller; the opposing player receives eleven guesses to complete the Hangman Word.

To enter your own Hangman Word into the computer, cycle through the alphabet letters on the screen while your opponent avoids looking at the screen. The Hangman Word may be between one and six letters.</desc>

The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.</desc>

		<name>Home Run</name>
		<desc>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.

The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</desc>

To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</desc>

Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive.

Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.

You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer. In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

It is the first video game to be based on the James Bond film series.

Players control British spy James Bond in his multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.

There are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, "Good luck, Mr. Bond." Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.

When a player's last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.

At the end of the game, the player also received a double-0 rating based on the difficulty of play (novice or agent), and how well the player did. If played at the novice difficulty, the maximum rating was 005, at agent difficulty, the maximum rating was 007.</desc>

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor.

If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit.

		<name>Laser Blast</name>
		<desc>The object of Laser Blast is to destroy a series of land-based enemies. The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.
Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.
Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.</desc>

		<name>LONDON BLITZ</name>
		<desc>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:

Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].
Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or
Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.</desc>

Lord of the Rings StoreThe Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell has been the subject of speculation for many years by Atari collectors. Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask?
Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</desc>

With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.</desc>

		<desc>You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.

When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.

The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.

Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Megamania</name>
		<desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title "Astro Blaster". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "Energy" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]
If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.</desc>

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

Your truck paid its dues during the early part of the competition, but you're confident that you've got the skills needed to outmaneuver Tom as you race for the finish line.

Your adrenalin pounds. You psych yourself up for the few remaining obstacles. You're only slightly ahead of Tom, but there are still a few more walls and cars to crush. Good thing you learned quickly to jump the mud which is slowing Tom down.

You rev your engine, add a burst of acceleration, and jump the last mud hole as you race for the finish line. Trucker Tom has finally met his match!</desc>

		<desc>The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.

If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.

There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</desc>

		<name>Off The Wall</name>
		<desc>Off the Wall is a video game developed for the Atari 2600 video game console in 1989. It is essentially a clone of Breakout with a Chinese theme. It was developed by Axlon, a game development studio owned by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell.

Players take control of the hero Kung Fu Lu, and the objective is smash through an evil wall to kill a dragon that has been tormenting villagers. In the game, Lu receives several power-ups to achieve his goal, and he must overcome a bat that stands in his way.

Atari later released another Breakout clone into video arcades, also called Off the Wall.

Off the Wall was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on December 1, 2010.</desc>

		<desc>Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>

		<name>Othello</name>
		<desc>You'll need strategy, foresight and cunning to be a success at this game.

The field is made up of a grid containing 64 squares.  Each player is designated by a color(white or black) and takes turns trying to capture as many squares as possible.  When you capture a square, it becomes your square and changes to your color.  Your corresponding score is displayed at the top of the screen.

To capture a square, you must OUTFLANK your opponent.  To do this, you must position your squares on the grid so that one or more of your opponent's squares is in a row which is bordered on each end by one of your squares.

If neither player can make a move the game is over.  This can occur when one player has no pieces left on the board.  It is also possible to end a game when there are blank squares on the board and both players have pieces left but there are no legal moves.</desc>

In the two player version, each player tries to be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary for as long as his bullet is on the screen.</desc>

Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round starts.</desc>

It's actually a very simple job--at first.  You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt.  Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors.  You must stack them correctly however, or--splat!!  As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep cool, and try not to earn the dubious title of "butterfingers."  Being a top notch bakery chef requires adeptness and a calm temperament, so if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!</desc>

		<desc>Prior to starting, players can choose which of the three mini-games they would like to play by selecting the icon for Captain Link, First Officer Piggy, or Dr. Strangepork. Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points.

Captain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.

First Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. 

The final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.</desc>

Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on a vine to avoid them. Treasure includes gold and silver bars, diamond rings, and bags of money. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various places. This is required to get around some surface areas that have no way across otherwise. The tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again. The tunnels also contain treasure and scorpions Harry must jump over.</desc>

Hindering your investigation are a number of obstacles, including potholes, falling objects, unfriendly animals, and knife-throwing thugs, to name a few.

You drive around the city in your modified 1935 Model A, which can jump as high as two stories. It can also make 90 and 180 degree turns on a dime. When you make the car jump, you also launch yourself out of it, enabling you to nab suspects in upper story windows.</desc>

Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire.

Both combatants enter the arena through the opening in the wall, and the frenzied game begins with the crack of the racquet against the first ball. The pace is fast and furious as the ball recoils from the backboard at ninety miles per hour. Are you fast enough to react in time to return the ball? Can you endure the fast pace and vanquish the opponent? If you are willing to try, it will leave you as breathless as a real game on a real court. WARNING: Don't let your opponent ace you...</desc>

		<name>Raiders of the Lost Ark</name>
		<desc>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</desc>

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human</desc>

		<name>Reactor</name>
		<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda pop vendors making their way up and down the bleachers.  The crowd roars after each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of "STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!" Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.

The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!</desc>

Enter the squared circle to face off against a friend or a computer-controlled opponent. Throw quick jabs and hard body blows until there's only one man left standing.

Watch out for Lefty O'Leary's brutal technique. Beware Jabbin' Jack's lightning quickness. Players pummel their way up the ladder, each victory leading to a more challenging adversary, until their boxer makes it to the top. Proven pugilists can then defend the coveted championship against a slew of fierce contenders.</desc>

As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.</desc>

Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

		<desc>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.

You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.

Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.</desc>

		<desc>Sky Jinks is a racing game that will have you weaving through pylons, trees and balloonists in an effort to finish one of five different courses as fast as possible. A top-down view of the course shows your P-41 plane and surrounding obstacles.

Use the fire button to accelerate and joystick to bank left or right as you make your way through the air. Each race differs in the amount of pylons you'll have to pass through -- red pylons require you to fly to the right, while blue pylons must be passed on the left. Missing a pylon will cost you three seconds on the clock.</desc>

		<desc>Gargamel has kidnapped Smurfette. As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time.
Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.
The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg. Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.</desc>

Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

		<desc>Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.

As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.

Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.

To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</desc>

Your photon ray pistol is activated by the joystick and the fire button. The iridescent eyes of the electrosauri light the cavern walls with eerie flashes as they stalk you, their horns crackling and sizzling. If even one blast of electro-molecular energy
strikes you, your skeleton will glow inside your body as the bio-molecular compounds of your body disintegrate.

You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars: The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>Star Wars is an arcade game produced by Atari Inc. and released in 1983.[2] The game is a first person space simulator, simulating the attack on the Death Star from the 1977 film Star Wars. The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.[3]


The player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker ("Red Five"), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. Unlike other arcade games of similar nature, the player does not have to destroy every enemy in order to advance through the game; he must simply survive as his fighter flies through the level, which most often means he must avoid or destroy the shots that enemies fire. Each hit on his craft takes away one shield (of the six he started out with), and if he runs out of shields and takes another hit, the game ends.

The player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.

In the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.
In the second phase, the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus if they manage to destroy a certain number of turrets.
In the final scenario, the player must navigate the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield up to a maximum of 6. Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, they are awarded a bonus for "using the Force."
The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases the difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.[2]</desc>

		<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.
Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.
Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

Your basic objective is to surround your opponent, causing him to run out of space in which to move, and at the same time not running into anything yourself. You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.

Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting. Be sure to read Section 4 to learn more about these features.

Then there's VIDEO GRAFFITI. It's just for fun without the competitive edge thrown in. VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen.

Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles released in September 1977.</desc>

The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms.

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

You enter FireWorld as a mighty warrior.  Your skill and courage will be tested with dangerous trials and obstacles.  The object of the game is to solve the puzzle.

The FireWorld puzzle is based on the Tree of Life, with ten rooms linked together by ten rooms with doorways.  FireWorld has ten treasure chest rooms, some containing different magical objects.  These objects will help you on your journey through FireWorld.  

Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you'll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.  As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld.  

To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues.  Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge.  These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle.

You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!</desc>

Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping him around in an airplane spin; letting go so he flies into the ropes and bounces back to meet Mad  Dog's concrete forearm across his neck... a perfectly executed clothesline. 

Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in. 

Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams him into the mat. Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up. 

Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive. As he lunges into the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's sweaty red skinned body splatters on the empty mat.</desc>

The arcade version was released in 1983. The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades. There were several home versions of the original; the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were only released as part of the Game, Set and Match II compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded by fans.</desc>

Tutankham is one of six games chosen to appear in the LIFE magazine photo-session conducted at Twin Galaxies on November 7, 1982, featuring video game record holders of the 1982-era, gathered for a group photograph. The Tutankham champion in the photo is Mark Robichek of Mountain View, California.</desc>

The goal is still the same: capture your opponent's king while protecting your own. Video Chess is a one-player game that offers eight different skill levels, including a special children's level that is appropriate for those still learning how to play.

Each player begins with sixteen pieces on opposite sides of a checkered game board: eight pawns, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, one queen and one king. One side plays with black, the other with white. Depending on the rank (with the pawn being the lowest and king highest), each piece can move across the board a certain number of spaces or in a specific direction.</desc>

abundance this year and worth much less than good country carrots).
 
The score on the left depicts the number of carrots the wabbits have snatched and deposited in their wabbit holes.  The current carrot count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one of your carrots.  Your score increases every time you wallop a wabbit with a wotten egg.  It's an egg-citing experience.</desc>

If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive.

You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.</desc>

The Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.
Xonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of "double-ender" cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.
Xonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.</desc>

Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of "double-ender" cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.
Xonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.</desc>

		<desc>n Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</desc>
