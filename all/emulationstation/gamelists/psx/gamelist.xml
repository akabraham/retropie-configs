		<name>Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere</name>
		<desc>In Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere the player takes the place of an ace fighter pilot who works for an organization called "UPEO" and has to accomplish various missions, e.g. taking out a special aircraft carrier or taking out enemy satellite systems in orbit around earth. The player can earn ratings from A to D: the higher the rating, the higher the chance that the player can acquire new kinds of planes. The game has many environments which range from normal aerial missions to stratospheric missions and even outer space missions. A special catch is that the player often has to make decisions during missions which influence the overall storyline. There is also an autopilot feature which can be used to land or reach a destination.</desc>

		<name>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</name>
		<desc>Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which nearly cost him the love of his life, Annette, and her sister, Maria. Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.

Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Cross (Disc 1)</name>
		<desc>Chrono Cross features standard RPG gameplay with some differences. Players advance the game by controlling the protagonist Serge through the game's world, primarily by foot and boat. Navigation between areas is conducted via an overworld map, much like Chrono Trigger's, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Around the island world are villages, outdoor areas, and dungeons, through which the player moves in three dimensions. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Like Chrono Trigger, the game features no random encounters; enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party</desc>

In contrast to X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Strider, rather than just Street Fighter characters. The game takes place within the Marvel comic continuity, as Professor Charles Xavier calls out for heroes to stop him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto and becomes the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game was developed in late 1997 and first released in January 1998.</desc>

		<desc>Taking place in an ambiguous year in the 22nd century (21XX) and following the third defeat of the "Maverick" robot Sigma, Cain Labs issues an initiative to create a supplementary military force to complement the "Maverick Hunters". The army, called the "Repliforce", is a strict regime led by General and his second-in-command, Colonel. Six months following the inception of the group, Cain Labs finds its methods to be ineffective, questionable, and potentially dangerous in the Maverick defense. To make matters worse, behind the scenes, General has been meeting with a mysterious figure who plots the Hunters' demise, insinuating that they are a significant threat to the jurisdiction of the Maverick Hunters. Mayhem breaks out when the Sky Lagoon, a massive floating city, is sent crashing down onto the city below it, killing millions of civilians, humans and Reploids alike. The game begins here where either X or Zero is dispatched to investigate possible causes of the disaster only to become entangled, once again, in a struggle against Sigma to save the world.</desc>

		<desc>Who needs rules? This version of the offensively minded NFL BLITZ is even more fast-paced, action-driven, and penalty-free than its ancestors. Using an amazingly intuitive controller configuration, BLITZ keeps it as simple as possible. It's all about excitement, as you choose between 27 effective offensive plays and nine defensive sets for your NFL franchise. The teams are all here, but reality has flown out the window, as you rip off helmets, throw punches, and dive at kickers. New features include individual stats based on NFL performance, new player animations, updated stadiums, multiplayer options in Season mode, better AI, new rants from the BLITZ announcer, and a cool new soundtrack. The highlight of the additions, however, has to be the Party Games mode, which allows up to four players to compete in crazy football challenges. In "1st and Goal Frenzy," you have four downs to score on your opponent; "Goal Line Stand" reverses the scenario and has you defending for four downs; and "Quarterback Challenge" has you passing at specific targets. Oh, and there's one more thing new cheerleaders.</desc>

		<desc>Who needs rules? This version of the offensively minded NFL BLITZ is even more fast-paced, action-driven, and penalty-free than its ancestors. Using an amazingly intuitive controller configuration, BLITZ keeps it as simple as possible. It's all about excitement, as you choose between 27 effective offensive plays and nine defensive sets for your NFL franchise. The teams are all here, but reality has flown out the window, as you rip off helmets, throw punches, and dive at kickers. New features include individual stats based on NFL performance, new player animations, updated stadiums, multiplayer options in Season mode, better AI, new rants from the BLITZ announcer, and a cool new soundtrack. The highlight of the additions, however, has to be the Party Games mode, which allows up to four players to compete in crazy football challenges. In "1st and Goal Frenzy," you have four downs to score on your opponent; "Goal Line Stand" reverses the scenario and has you defending for four downs; and "Quarterback Challenge" has you passing at specific targets. Oh, and there's one more thing new cheerleaders.</desc>

		<name>PaRappa the Rapper</name>
		<desc>PARAPPA THE RAPPER is about a rapping dog named PaRappa and his friends PJ Berri, Sunny Funny, and Katy Kat. Appearing almost more like a cartoon than a game, it follows PaRappa's fascination with Sunny Funny, a sunflower. PaRappa will go through several rites of passage learning courage, getting a driving license, and going on dates. The crux of PaRappa lies in the rapping segments of the game. To get to the next stage, you must reproduce the raps of a number of teachers. Rapping is accomplished by pressing the correct buttons at the correct moments, all in time to the music. This may sound easy, and it is at first, but it gets more and more difficult as the game goes on. With impressive visuals, a memorable soundtrack, and a cast of oddball characters, PARAPPA THE RAPPER is a PlayStation classic.</desc>

Return Fire is a war game based on the age-old concept of 'capture the flag'. Using your array of vehicles: choppers, tanks, jeeps, and even APC's, you set out on your mission. Over one-hundred different map locations provides an adequate challenge. But if you get bored with defeating the enemy, mat skill and wits with a friend in the two-player challenge mode.</desc>

		<name>Risk</name>
		<desc>Aspects of the classic game, like building armies and seizing territories, are brought to life through animation and graphics. The version also offers a variation on the classic game, titled Ultimate Risk, which further enhances gameplay by including weather, terrain, POWs, and more, features not possible with the limitations of the board version. These features add a new dynamic to the already challenging game by forcing users to consider alternate strategies from the original board game version.

Five maps are available for strategizing, including the classic world map with six continents and the American map, with 14 additional countries and 153 territories. If playing the classic version, players choose from three varying game objectives. In World Domination, the last player standing wins the game, while the Capital Risk module establishes a goal of conquering the opposing player's secretly designated capital. The last objective, Mission Risk, involves completing a mission designated by drawing a random card.</desc>

With money gained, the player can then purchase skill improvements and better skateboards. THPS2 was also the first game in the series to introduce the manual, a skateboarding trick where the performer balances on two wheels. This enables players to string together trick combos. The game also introduced the Noseslide, Tailslide, Bluntslide, Nosebluntside, Feeble, and Overcrook grinds. It was also the first of the Pro Skater games to feature Create-a-Skater and Park Editor features, now staples in the series.</desc>

		<desc>Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs. Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time. He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.</desc>

		<name>Crash Bandicoot</name>
		<desc>Crash Bandicoot, a heroic, agile and mutated marsupial who must save his girlfriend Tawna. The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish (but nearly workable) theories and is now motivated to prove his tormentors wrong by creating a mutated army of beasts to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female bandicoot about to undergo experimentation by the Doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit named Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special powers. The boss characters of the game include Papu Papu, the obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, the tommy gun-wielding bodyguard of Doctor Cortex.</desc>
